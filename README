Universal Navigation
=========

Universal Navigation allows for multiple Rails apps to use a single set of tabs to navigation between them.  The tabs will use either the app's "home_path" (the landing page of the app) or "entity_path" (a page dedicated to listing entities that are related to the previous page's entity), depending on the context.

The only required Rails plugin is: 
- jrails			git://github.com/aaronchi/jrails.git

The jQuery UI library is also required, and it needs to include UI Tabs.  This plugin has currently only been tested on jQuery 1.3.2 and jQuery UI 1.7.
